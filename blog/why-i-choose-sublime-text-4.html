			<h1>Why I Choose Sublime Text 4</h1>
			<p>
				I've tried a bunch of different code editors - VS Code, Atom, VIM, Emacs, even Gedit. I kept switching between editors because something was missing. Then I found Sublime Text.
			</p>
			<h2>What the Others Were Lacking</h2>
			<p>
				I realized I liked the auto-completion, Emmet support and hints of VS Code and Atom. I liked the lightness and speed of VIM and Emacs and I like the simple UI of Gedit. The problem was that none of these editors had it all - autocompletion built in that worked well, code hinting, easy package installation, and speed. VS Code and Atom had the first three but they just bogged down if you were running a server in the background.
			</p>
			<p>
				Not that it took forever but there was a noticeable delay if I was opening a file - maybe a second or two. How much could this really slow you down? I noticed a lot of people babbling about "coding at the speed of thought" with VIM or some other nonsense. That's not really the way it works. Waiting a second or two for a file to open isn't a big deal in terms of actually writing the code - lot's of the time you're just looking at the screen but this isn't what the speed issue, at least in my mind, is about.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>It's about FLOW.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				The flow of thought, not the speed you can type. Opening a file with super fast speed doesn't allow you to type faster - it keeps the flow of your thoughts from being disrupted. There's no slowness on typing like VS Code either - this can affect your flow as well. Sublime is even fast on lower end machines - I code on both Window machines and Chromebooks running Linux - it flies on all of these.
			</p>
			<h2>A Simple UI</h2>
			<p>To me another great feature of Sublime is the simple UI - it's not cluttered. The UI of Sublime is nice and classy - it has some great syntax themes and the UI theme can be either light, dark, or adaptive - or even match your operating system. I like the default light UI theme with the Monokai syntax theme (and also Marianna).</p>
			<p>Check out the Monokai Syntax theme with a React file open below:</p>

			<p>Here is the theme with the default UI:</p>

			</figure>
			<p>You'll notice that this is a really nice setup. If you don't like the light UI you can change all that to dark easily as well - and there are plenty of other themes - both light and dark. Here are some of the dark ones - I've been coding with dark themes lately.</p>

			</div>
			<p>As you can see you can mix it up quite a bit with the themes.</p>
			<p>You can also do cool things like hide the menu bar to really clean up your UI and just focus on the code.</p>
			<h3>Hide the Menu Bar</h3>
			<p>You can also hide the menu bar by going to View -> hide menu. You can easily get it back and visible by typing alt-v and then clicking show menu. This really gives the editor a simplistic UI similar to Gedit but with a faster speed and the functionality of VS Code.</p>
			<h2>Packages, packages, packages</h2>
			<p>Packages are additional pieces of code that can be downloaded to extend the functionality of the text editor - VS Code, Atom, VIM, Emacs, and Gedit all have additional packages which are sometimes referred to as plugins.</p>
			<p>Sublime text also allows packages to be installed - you can install packages that improve syntax highlighting for various languages, packages that format your code, and packages that provide code snippets, for instance. This all makes your life easier when coding.</p>
			<p>First just install "package control" - open the command palette with control-shift-p and type "install package control" or "package control" and it will come up - you can then install packages in the command palette with package control: install package - then type the package you're looking for.</p>
			<h2>But What About the Cost?</h2>
			<p>I see a lot of people whining online about the cost of $99 for a license for Sublime Text. Am I missing something? How cheap are you? If you use a text editor every day $99 for a license that covers your for updates for 3 years and allows you to use the latest edition of Sublime within that 3 year period forever on all of your computers isn't that much. $33 a year isn't that much.</p>
			<p>I can understand the price issue if you're a student but if you're a professional programmer if you can't afford $99 something is off, especially for something you use every day.</p>
			<p>I get that VS Code and Atom are free but this editor is just fast and snappy. Overall, to me the cost is worth it.</p>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Sublime Text is a great text editor similar in functionality to VS Code and Atom but without the sluggish behavior. It's fast, snappy, and responsive and the nominal cost of $99 for 3 years of updates is worth it to me. I love it!</p>
